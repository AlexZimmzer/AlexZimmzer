      <p>In this course, we explore basic web development applications including HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.<br>
      We also look at vulnerabilities and attacks using hackathon assignments.<br>
      The course repository is linked <a href="https://github.com/AlexZimmzer/waph-zimmead">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Lab 1</h2>
      <p>In this lab, we were introduced to HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), Wireshark, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) applications, and GET/POST requests. This lab was focused on introducing basic web application.</p>

      <h2>Lab 2</h2>
      <p>In this lab, we worked with basic HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API integration to create an information page. It included a digital clock, GET and POST request forms, and integration of JokeAPI.</p>

      <h2>Hackathon 1</h2>
      <p>In this hackathon, we looked at XSS (Cross-site Scripting Attacks) and defenses. To do this, we worked through various exercises on the course Apache page and used various methods including using GET/POST requests to display an alert on the page. We also provided the webpage we created in Lab 2 with defenses to prevent these attacks.</p>
