## Individual Project 1

## Overview
In this project, I used what I learned from Lab 2 and lectures to create a professional profile website deployed using GitHub's cloud service.

Porject URL: [https://alexzimmzer.github.io/index.html](https://alexzimmzer.github.io/index.html)

## Page Information

For this task, I created two pages; index.html and waph.html. The first page is the profile page that contains my information, a bio, work experience, and skills. The latter page contains information about the course, including labs and hackathons. 

## CSS/Bootstrap

For this task, I utilized a free Bootstrap template to organize my website, found on [3rd Wave Media](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/). I copied the template index.html file and replaced the information with my own, changing the CSS reference to be the local GitHub repository. This template utilized FontAwesome icons for various parts of the page, including the LinkedIn/Github icons, and the icons next to the email and phone numbers. I also included a page tracker using [Flag Counter](https://flagcounter.com/) to count the amount of vistors the site recieves. I did this by creating a separate section below my work experience that included the tag provided on the page.

## Technical Information

I also utilized jQuery when building this site by adding the tools from Lab 2 such as the digital/analog clock. I also added the function to show and hide my email in the header. I had to change the formatting of it compared to the use in Lab 2 as it was formatted this time using CSS in order for it to appear properly.
Additionally, I created a section in the sidebar that used the JokeAPI from Lab 2, allowing it to display any joke from any category and refreshes every minute.
I also used the [Weatherbit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/) to display the current weather in Cincinnati, OH on the sidebar. The API also has a tool to display an icon associated with the weather, which gets displayed. 
The website also contains a cookie tracker at the top of the page, that displays a message depending on if it is your first visit or if you have visited before, showing the last visit time.
